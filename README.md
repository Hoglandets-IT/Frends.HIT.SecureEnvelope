# Building

Clone a copy of the repo

`git clone https://github.com/CommunityHiQ/Frends.Community.PaymentServices.Nordea.git`

Restore dependencies

`nuget restore frends.community.paymentservices.nordea`

Rebuild the project

Note: The code cannot be properly tested without a working connection to Nordea's Web Service, so no separate tests are included in the code. See "Testing" for more information.

Create a nuget package

`nuget pack nuspec/Frends.Community.Email.nuspec`

# Testing

Testing and using the tasks requires a working connection to Nordea's Web Service. In order to connect to Nordea's Web Service the following things are needed:

- An agreement with Nordea. Without an agreement there is no Customer Id, no Target Id and no way to obtain the needed certificate.
- A client specific (production) certificate. The web service does not have a separate test environment, so the same certificate is used for tests and production use. The easiest way to obtain the certificate is probably using Nordea's security client program. Full instructions can be found from Nordea's web page. The certificate should be installed under Personal/Certificates in the FRENDS agent's certificate store.
- Nordea root cerficate. 

When the certificate is obtained and installed, and the needed ID values are known, the connection to Nordea's web service can be tested with either task GetUserInfo or DownloadFileList, as these only fetch information and do not modify anything at Nordea's end. Assuming there is some material to test with, DownLoadFile and UploadFile can be tested as soon as the connection to the web service works.

When testing - and especially when testing UploadFile - care should be taken that the environment parameter is TEST, as there is no separate test environment for the web service. If, for example, test material is uploaded with environment parameter PRODUCTION, the material will be processed in production. 

Note: The url http://filetransfer.test.nordea.com/services/CorporateFileService is only available when Corporate eGateway is used. It is used as the tasks' default value for the url as a small safeguard agains sending requests to production environment unintentionally.

These tasks utilize Nordea's implementation of [Web Services channel](http://www.finanssiala.fi/maksujenvalitys/dokumentit/WebServices_Messages_20081022_105.pdf). Details of Nordea's implementation can be found [here](https://www.nordea.fi/yritysasiakkaat/palvelumme/verkko-mobiilipalvelut/palvelukuvaukset.html#tab=Palvelukuvaukset-S-O). These documents are also backed up in Documents folder.
